🌍 City Rankings: Based on cost of living, gym density, safety, visa rules, and vibe.

✈️ Trip Planning Tools: Find the best places to “roll while you roam.”

👥 Community Reviews: Ratings and tips from grapplers who’ve trained there.

📅 Event Calendar: Competitions, open mats, and seminars by location.
